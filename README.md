# Target Market Analysis Using Supervised Machine Learning From Customers' Historical Purchase Data.

This project was part of my group capstone during Junior Data Scientist Program by The Center of Applied Data Science(CADS)
* Designed a predictive model to determine the potential customers who will purchase after we send an advertisement.
* Performed data cleaning, feature engineering to prepare it for classification machine learning application.
* ML algorithms such as LogReg, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM are applied to choose the best prediction model.
